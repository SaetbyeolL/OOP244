The most important things in this entire WS4 workshop were the constructor&destructor and 'this'. 
Within member functions, We can use a pointer named 'this', which is a pointer to the address of the object itself. 
The address value and data type of the 'this' pointer are not fixed. We use the term 'this' when we support a class and need a pointer 
to represent itself inside the class.
The constructor has the same name as the class and is called when the class is instantiated, and the destructor is called 
when the main function ends and is destroyed.  In w4p2, CleanerBot(); this constructor set the robot into an empty state. 
When the main function ends, ~CleanerBot(); is called and is destroyed. 
The most difficult part was the 'int report(CleanerBot* bot, short num_bots)'. It is a function that calls several functions and outputs them, 
it took the most time because countless errors occurred in the process of calling several functions.
