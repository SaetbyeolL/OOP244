In this workshop, 'FullName class' inherits 'Name class' and outputs the name as Name+Lastname. 
'Name class' override all the member functions of the Base class Name. Since there is a character pointer type m_value in 'Name class', 
I made copy constructor, copy assignment and destruction(rule of three). When an instance of the FullName class is created, 
the constructor of FullName is not executed first, but the default constructor of the base class (Name) is executed first 
and then the FullName() constructor is executed. 
The most difficult part was "std::istream&FullName::read(std::istream& istr)". 
To figure it out, "The newline character is removed from istream and the istream reference is returned." I had to use 'getline'. 
MS4 had a similar structure to workshop9. Also, "std::istream& Book::read(std::istream& is)" of 'Book.cpp' of MS4 was difficult and took a lot of time as well. 
I kept checking the output value. I thought I should definitely study the concepts of 'get' and 'getline' more.
