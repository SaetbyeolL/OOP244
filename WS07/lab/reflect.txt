The most important parts to study in W7 and MILESTONE is base or parent class. 
Inheritance is to use member variables of parent class' or 'member functions of parent class' in child classes, 
except for 'private' in the parent class. By declaring the common variables and functions 
of multiple objects in one class, there is no need to re-create variables or functions that perform the same function. 
In W7, "Minister::Minister(const char* id, int age, int year, const char* name, const char* district) : MemberParliament(id, age)" 
This is the part where inheritance occurs. When creating an instance of Minister, 
Minister's custom constructor inherits MemberParliament's id and age. 
Since I was new to the concept of inheritance, it took time to implement the function.
The additional difficult part was implementing the Menu class and MenuItem in MS1. 
the MenuItem class can only be accessed using the Menu class. For this, 'friend class Menu;' I added the term "friend".
It took a long time to declare member variables, member functions, 
and custom input/output operators because it is the first step to moving forward with the future project.
