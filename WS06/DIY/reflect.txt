The difficult part in this workshop was the copy constructor and a copy assignment operator. 
A copy constructor is a constructor (member function) that initializes by passing an argument 
to another object of the same class type as itself in the form of a reference (&). 
The copy constructor is called only once during initialization. 
The copy constructor is used to reduce the hassle of re-assigning member data to a new object 
when creating an object in the same class. It is convenient because it is used to get information of an object 
that already exists. The newly created object is the same as the original object and has complete independence.
The copy assignment operator is used to overwrite an object already assigned a value with another object. 
Since the copy assignment operator may already have a value in the existing object, 
the resource of the existing object must be removed.
