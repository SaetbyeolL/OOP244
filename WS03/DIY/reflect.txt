I was too confused to fully understand the concept of class. It took me a long time to understand 
and realize that I can include a Bar pointer to hold the dynamically allocated array of Bars(Bar* m_Bar;) in a class called 'BarChart' 
and think about how to apply it to coding.

"void Bar::draw()const " 3 functions (setf, width, fill) newly discovered in this function were used to set the output value on the screen 
the same as in the example. setf is a fill function that aligns the input value from the left, width is the width of the character, 
and fills the rest. The values ​​to be output are neatly arranged using these three functions.

'void BarChart::init(const char* title, int noOfSamples, char fill)' this member function was the most challenging part. 
I just learned dynamic allocation last week, so I'm still not used to it. In this function, 
I allocated the dynamically allocated memories for m_titleOfChart and m_Bar to initialize the Chart. 

m_titleOfChart = new char[strlen(title) + 1];
m_Bar = new Bar[m_sizeOfBar];
